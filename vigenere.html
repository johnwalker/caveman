          <p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokey_cipher">
              In an autokey cipher</a>, the plaintext is incorporated
            into the key. Choose a password of length n to encrypt
            the first n characters of the plaintext. Those n
            characters of the plaintext are used to encrypt the
            following n characters. Characters that aren't in the
            alphabet are unchanged in the ciphertext, only
            characters that are in the alphabet may be in the
            password, and no password character is "skipped" because
            of plaintext that isn't in the alphabet. We repeat the
            process until all plaintext has been encrypted. </p>
